# Image Processing
## _What is it about_
This repository contains some practical works that I've done about __image processing__ during my master degree.

## _What can be found_
You can find five practical works that each deal with a different subject of image processing which are : 
- [Thresholding](https://github.com/AxelDubar/Traitement-des-images/tree/main/TP1_Seuillage) : This is more an introduction on how to operate on a image, it consist in implementing a thresholding algorithm on greyscale images, then on colored images.
- [Morphological operations](https://github.com/AxelDubar/Traitement-des-images/tree/main/TP2_Dilatation_Erosion) : Implementation of morphological operations dilation and erosion and their combination opening and closure of an image.
- [Histogram equalisation](https://github.com/AxelDubar/Traitement-des-images/tree/main/TP3_Egalisation_Histogramme) : Histogram manipulation in order to correct contrast of an image.
- [Blurring](https://github.com/AxelDubar/Traitement-des-images/tree/main/TP4_Floutage) : Applying blur in the background of an image
- [Contour detection](https://github.com/AxelDubar/Traitement-des-images/tree/main/TP5_Detection_Contour) : Detection and highlighting of the countour of an image
